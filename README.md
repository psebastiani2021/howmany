## What is howmany?
howmany (or howMany) is a console application that is able to measure a variety of things related to your personal information, text length, and more &mdash; everything with simple C# code.
## Instructions to run
To run howMany in a console, you can use .NET for Visual Studio Code ([you can install the framework here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)). After finishing the .NET Installation Wizard, enter Visual Studio Code and import the .cs file you'd like to try. Then, click <b>Run</b> > <i>Start Debugging</i>. A dropdown list will appear, and pick the .NET version you installed.

If you don't have or can't install this framework, you can try online C# compilers or interpreters - you can run them by copying the program's code. Here are some links to C# playgrounds:
